"Block Processor Queue" --> Process Blocks
note right
Blocks added to block processor queue are encapsulated 
in an **unchecked_info** object.

Blocks must have valid work before being added to
block_processor queue. In addition, block hashes are 
added to lookup table to avoid being processed
more than once. Blocks not found in lookup table
nor located in rolled_back table will be added to
either **state_blocks** or **blocks** queue. When blocks
are added, it notifies block_processor to run if not
already running.

The block_processor thread is responsible for processing
all **unchecked** blocks. All blocks start in this state.

note top
Attempt to verify the following:

Block does not exist in ledger
<secondary review>...

Limit verification range to [ **1**, **2048 x signature_checker_threads + 1**]
or by setting **block_processor_verification_size**
end note

Limit run-time to:

**block_processor_batch_max_time**: Total time to allow blocks
to be processed

or 

**block_processor_batch_size** : Total blocks to process per run
