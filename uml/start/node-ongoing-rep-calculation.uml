(*)--> get_current_timestamp

get_current_timestamp -right> vote_processor.calculate_weights

note right

**supply** represents online_reps online stake from node's perspective
**weight** represents weight manually assigned to reps by account holders

3 weighted buckets are created based on represetnatives weight class

1st: weight > supply/1000 (**0.1% or above**)
2nd: weight > supply/100 (**1% or above**)
3rd: weight > supply/20 (**5% or above**)

These buckets are used by the **vote_processor** to quickly determine if
a representative is a voting rep.
end note

vote_processor.calculate_weights --> "10 minute timer"

if expired

--> "10 minute timer"
